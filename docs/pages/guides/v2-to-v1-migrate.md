# Move from pooled to dedicated (v2 → v1)

Suppose you built **Bloom Atelier** on **v2 shared** (pooled Postgres and PostgREST behind the Flux gateway) and you are ready for **v1 dedicated** (your own Postgres and PostgREST containers). Flux can orchestrate that move with **`flux migrate`**.

This page is about **changing execution engine** for an existing project. It is not about SQL schema files—those stay in Git and remain the source of truth; see [Migrations workflow](/docs/guides/migrations).

## What you will learn

- How **`flux migrate`** relates to the **control plane** versus your app’s **Service URL**
- A safe order: **dry run → optional dump-only → staged or full migrate**
- A **success checklist** after a full cutover (CLI, dashboard, Docker, app env)
- Why errors mention **`pg_dump`** on the server, not on your laptop

## The idea

**v2 shared** and **v1 dedicated** are both real PostgreSQL-backed stacks; the difference is **where** data lives and **how strong** the isolation boundary is. In practice, **v2 shared** is often where people first learn Flux—free tier, shared cluster, and neighbor load can mean higher latency or tighter limits than a dedicated stack. None of that makes pooled mode a toy; it is a different deployment model.

The **v1** / **v2** labels name **execution strategies** (dedicated containers versus pooled cluster), not a universal “newer is better” ranking. Choose dedicated when isolation, compliance posture, or predictable capacity outweigh the operational simplicity of shared infrastructure.

Teams often start on pooled infrastructure, then move a project to dedicated when policy, risk, or operations call for a container-level boundary. That is a product choice—not a statement that pooled mode is “fake.”

**`flux migrate`** talks to the **control plane API** (`…/api/cli/v1/migrate`), not to your tenant **Service URL** (`https://api--<slug>--<hash>.…`). Your browser and server components call the Service URL for rows; the CLI calls the dashboard API to provision, dump, and flip **`projects.mode`**.

So you need:

1. A working **CLI login** to the same control plane that owns the project.
2. For **hosted** deployments, the CLI can infer **`FLUX_API_BASE`** from **`FLUX_URL`** (or **`NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUX_URL`**) when those point at a **`*.vsl-base.com`** tenant host—see [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) and [Environment variables](/docs/reference/env-vars). **Self-hosted** still needs an explicit **`FLUX_API_BASE`** if your Service URL is on a custom domain.
3. The project **slug** and **seven-character hash** from **`flux list`** (or the dashboard), passed on every command as **`--project <slug>`** and **`--hash <hex>`**. A repo-root **`flux.json`** with the same **`slug`** and **`hash`** is optional—it only saves repeating those flags for other CLI commands like **`flux push`**; **`flux migrate` does not require it**. See [Configuration](/docs/reference/config).

The control plane runs **`pg_dump`** against the **shared cluster** during migration. That binary must exist **on the host that runs the dashboard**, not merely on your laptop.

## Before you start

- Confirm the project is **`v2_shared`** (`flux list` or the dashboard). **`flux migrate`** refuses other modes.
- Run **`flux login`** successfully against the intended control plane.
- Commit or back up anything you care about; a **full** migrate expects **downtime** while containers are reprovisioned and data is restored.
- Read [Pooled vs dedicated](/docs/concepts/pooled-vs-dedicated) so expectations on isolation and URLs stay aligned.

## Step 1 — Plan without changing anything

Run from any directory (the examples use **`-p`** / **`--hash`** explicitly):

```bash
flux migrate -p bloom-atelier --hash 61d9dff --to v1_dedicated --dry-run
```

Use your real **slug** and **hash** from **`flux list`**. If you keep a **`flux.json`** for **`flux push`**, you may omit those flags when your shell **current working directory** is that repo—**`migrate` still validates** that the hash’s slug matches **`-p`** when both are present. Inspect the printed **`plan`** and **`preflight`** (schemas, table counts, etc.). Fix surprises before you add **`--yes`**.

## Step 2 — Optional: dump-only (still no engine flip)

This asks the control plane to run **`pg_dump`** for the tenant schema and write a file **on the control plane host**. It does **not** switch the project to dedicated by itself.

```bash
flux migrate -p bloom-atelier --hash 61d9dff --to v1_dedicated --dump-only --yes
```

Use this to validate connectivity and tooling (`pg_dump` on the server, shared DB URL) before you accept downtime.

## Step 3 — Staged migrate (data on dedicated, catalog still pooled)

**`--staged`** provisions the dedicated stack and restores from the dump, but **does not** flip **`projects.mode`** to **`v1_dedicated`** yet. Use it when you want to inspect the dedicated database before the public cutover.

```bash
flux migrate -p bloom-atelier --hash 61d9dff --to v1_dedicated --staged --yes
```

Do **not** combine **`--staged`** with **`--new-jwt-secret`**; the catalog secret would no longer match the new stack.

## Step 4 — Full migrate (cut over to v1_dedicated)

When you are ready for the catalog to record **dedicated** and for traffic expectations to follow:

```bash
flux migrate -p bloom-atelier --hash 61d9dff --to v1_dedicated --yes
```

By default the control plane enters **gateway maintenance** for the tenant while work is in flight (omit **`--no-lock-writes`** unless you understand the risk of writes during the move).

After success, **`flux list`** should show the project as **v1_dedicated** and the **Service URL** shape your deployment documents (flattened host is the usual external contract).

### Optional flags (check `flux migrate --help`)

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **`--new-jwt-secret`** | Rotate **`jwt_secret`** on cutover; update every client that mints JWTs for PostgREST. |
| **`--drop-source-after`** | After a **non-staged** success, remove the tenant from the **shared** cluster—**destructive**; only when you are sure dedicated is authoritative. |

## After a successful full migrate

When **`flux migrate … --yes`** (without **`--staged`**) returns **`"message": "Migration complete. Project is now v1_dedicated."`**, walk this checklist before you call the cutover done.

If you **only** ran **`--staged`**, the catalog is still **`v2_shared`** until you run that final full migrate—treat the staged success message as confirmation that the **dedicated** database is populated, not that public traffic or **`flux list`** mode has flipped yet.

### Success checklist

1. **CLI** — Run **`flux list`**: the project row should show **`v1_dedicated`** and the **Service URL** you expect (often the same flattened **`https://api--<slug>--<hash>.…`** pattern when slug and hash are unchanged). This page’s **`flux migrate`** path applies only while the project is **`v2_shared`**; after cutover, use dedicated-day-to-day commands (**`flux push`**, repair, lifecycle) as for any **`v1_dedicated`** project.
2. **Dashboard** — Open **Projects**: the card should show **Online** / **Healthy** (or your fleet labels), the **API URL** field should match **`flux list`**, and **v1**-style lifecycle actions (for example **Stop**) should appear where your host enables them. Pooled-only affordances disappear because the project is no longer on the shared engine.
3. **Docker host** — On the machine that runs tenant containers, **`docker ps`** should list this project’s **Postgres** and **PostgREST** pair (names like **`flux-<hash>-<slug>-db`** and **`flux-<hash>-<slug>-api`**). That confirms dedicated provisioning, not only a catalog flip.
4. **Optional cleanup** — If you intentionally used **`--drop-source-after`** on a **non-staged** run, confirm the tenant schema is gone from the **shared** cluster so you are not paying for two copies of truth. If you did **not** use that flag, the v2 copy may still exist until operators remove it under your own policy.

### Update your app (Bloom or any project)

1. Refresh **`NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUX_URL`** / **`FLUX_URL`** (and any server-only base URL) from **`flux list`** or the dashboard if the Service URL or routing identity changed.
2. If you rotated secrets (**`--new-jwt-secret`**), run **`flux project credentials`** (or the dashboard) and paste the new **`FLUX_GATEWAY_JWT_SECRET`** (or equivalent) into your env files. With default **`preserveJwtSecret`** behavior, secrets often stay the same—still verify.
3. Dedicated stacks expose your tenant API schema as provisioned; if you previously targeted **`t_<shortId>_api`** only on v2, re-read [Service URLs](/docs/concepts/service-urls) and your RLS **`GRANT`**s—**RLS without grants** still yields **`42501`**.

Re-run your smoke tests (`curl` or app E2E) before you announce cutover.

## Troubleshooting

Errors below split **hosted Flux** (you use `flux.vsl-base.com` or another vendor-run control plane) from **self-hosted** (you run the dashboard API and Docker host yourself). See [Production hardening](/docs/guides/production-hardening) for operator-focused context.

### **`pg_dump` not found** (control plane)

Migrate runs **`pg_dump` on the server** that serves the control-plane API, not on your laptop.

- **Hosted:** This is a **platform packaging** issue. Confirm **`FLUX_API_BASE`** points at the real dashboard API origin, then **contact Flux support** or watch the vendor status channel—you cannot install tools into the hosted control plane from your app repo.
- **Self-hosted operators:** Install PostgreSQL **client** binaries (**`pg_dump`**) in the **dashboard/control-plane runtime** (the same environment that executes `/api/cli/v1/migrate`), then **rebuild and redeploy** that service so a fresh container includes them. Restarting an old image without rebuilding will not add **`pg_dump`**.

### **`invalid command \restrict`** during restore

Newer **`pg_dump`** output can include psql meta-commands **`\\restrict`** / **`\\unrestrict`** that older **`psql`** inside the tenant Postgres container rejects.

- **Hosted:** The control plane must ship a release that **sanitizes** those lines when the dedicated Postgres major version is **before 17**. If you see this on hosted Flux after you are already on the latest CLI, **contact support**—it is not something you fix in application SQL.
- **Self-hosted operators:** Deploy a **dashboard** build that includes that sanitization on the restore path, then retry **`--staged`** or full migrate. Optionally align **`pg_dump`** / **`psql`** client majors with your tenant image if you maintain both images yourself.

### **`role "service_role" does not exist`** (PostgREST probe)

PostgREST maps the JWT **`role`** claim to a **database role**; dedicated tenant DBs must define **`service_role`** like **`anon`** / **`authenticated`**.

- **Hosted:** The **tenant bootstrap** on the control plane must create that role. If the probe fails on hosted Flux, **contact support** or wait for a platform update, then rerun migrate (often after containers are recreated).
- **Self-hosted operators:** Ship an updated **tenant bootstrap** (or run a one-off **`CREATE ROLE service_role`**, **`GRANT … TO authenticator`**, and schema grants) on existing volumes that predate the role, then rerun migrate.

### Other CLI issues

- **`Request failed` / wrong project**: confirm **`FLUX_API_BASE`** points at **your** dashboard **`/api`** origin, not only at the tenant API host.
- **Slug/hash mismatch**: the **`-p`** slug must match the project that owns the **`--hash`** row in **`flux list`** for your API token. If you use **`flux.json`**, its **`slug`** / **`hash`** must match that same row—otherwise pass explicit **`-p`** / **`--hash`** and ignore or fix the file.
